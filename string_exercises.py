# 1) write a function that displays the string "Hello World!" on the console

# 2) write a function that takes a string as a parameter and displays it on the console

# 3) write a function that takes a name (type string) as parameter and returns the following string
#    "Hi there, <name>!". hint: google f"{}" in python

# 4) write a function that takes a full name as a parameter and displays it on the console
#    the same name 3 times: first time in uppercase, second time in lowercase and third time only initial letters
#    with capital letters. Example: input: "gregorio canepa". output: GREGORIO CANEPA, gregorio canepa, Gregorio Canepa

# 5) write a function that takes two parameter: first parameter: a random sentence, second parameter: a single word.
#    The function should return true if the word in the second parameter exists in the sentence from the first parameter.
#    Example: "I drink mate all the time." "coffee". Output: False


# 6) Write a Python program to check whether a string starts with specified characters. 
# Example: main_string = "Java is the worst." substring = "Python".
# Expected output: False

# 7) Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word and the length of the longest one.
# Sample list: ["this", "exercise", "is", "quite", "easy"] 
# Expected output: 'Longest word: "exercise". Length of the longest word: 9'

# 8) Exercise 5 2.0: Write a function that takes two parameters: 
# first parameter: a random sentence, second parameter: a single word.
# The function should return true if the word in the second parameter exists in the sentence from the first parameter.
# You can't use "if word in sentence" sintax.
# Example: "I drink mate all the time." "coffee". Output: False.

# 9) Write a Python program to count occurrences of a substring in a string.
# main_string = "Python is a great language. Python can be used for web development and data science.
#               It's name comes from the british comedy group Monty Python."
# substring = "Python"

# 10) Write a python program that replaces commas "," with dots "." and dots with commas.
# original_string = "In some countries people write decimals like this: 3.14, whereas other write it this way 3,14."
# expected output: "In some countries people write decimals like this: 3,14. whereas other write it this way 3.14,"
